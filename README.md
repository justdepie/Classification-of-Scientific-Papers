This group project was developed by Agelonidi Despoina, Mylona Eirini, and Stavropoulos Christos, who are students enrolled in the elective course "Data Science Challenge" within the Data Science Master program at Athens University of Economic and Business. The main objective of the project was to classify scientific papers using a citation network consisting of thousands of research papers. The dataset provided for the project included abstracts, author lists, and publication years of the papers.
